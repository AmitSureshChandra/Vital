Andrew Lessman\u2019s MAXIMUM EYE SUPPORT is a comprehensive high-potency blend of more than a dozen targeted nutrients phytonutrients and anti-oxidants to support healthy vision and protect the delicate tissues of the eye. It contains our highest levels of Lutein Zeaxanthin and Bilberry arguably the most important nutrients for eye health. Lutein and Zeaxanthin are two powerfully protective naturally occurring carotenoids and when consumed they will be most highly concentrated in the lens and macular region of the retina. Maximum Eye Support provides 12 mg of Lutein which is dozens of times more than most leading multivitamins. It also contains 4 mg of Zeaxanthin \u2013 just as important as Lutein but ignored by the leading multivitamins and only found at low levels (if at all) in most eye formulas. Lutein and Zeaxanthin offer Mother Nature\u2019s most powerful protection from light-induced oxidative damage. These two remarkable ingredients were naturally designed to protect the lens and macula region of the retina from UV radiation Blue Light and other oxidative assaults. Lutein and Zeaxanthin can be concentrated to protect vulnerable eye tissues but since they cannot be produced by the body their benefits are only available from food or supplements. Given the low levels of Lutein and Zeaxanthin in the American diet supplementation is a vital consideration. Maximum Eye Support also contains a high potency blend of Bilberry and Elderberry Extracts standardized for Anthocyanins which are the deep purple protective anti-oxidants that also help to maintain healthy night vision by supporting the regeneration of the visual purple portion of the retina. Maximum Eye Support also provides the protection of high levels of not just Alpha Vitamin E but the even more protective and all-important Gamma Tocopherol \u2013 both are well-known for their protective benefits to delicate eye tissue. We also provide high levels of our Green Tea Extract standardized to deliver exceptionally high levels of EGCG (Epigallocatechin Gallate) to further protect the fragile tissues of the retina from oxidative damage. Our standardized Grape Seed Extract is rich in OPCs (Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins) and is combined with our Citrus Bioflavonoid Extract to offer targeted support to the vital and delicate circulation to the eye. No eye formula would be complete without the well-known well-researched and well-established benefits of our mild non-acidic Vitamin C. Our quality of life depends on healthy eyes and vision and our Maximum Eye Support provides Mother Nature\u2019s best tools to protect the lens retina macula and other delicate tissues of the eye from a lifetime of oxidative assaults.

ACTUAL SIZE PRENATAL DHAGNC Prenatal DHA is a premium vegetarian source of DHA tailored specifically with the health of your baby in mind. Pregnancy is a special time in a woman's life and a time to be mindful of the nutritional needs of you and your baby. Maternal nutrition before during and after pregnancy affects both your well-being and your infant's growth.It is highly recommended that mothers ingest DHA during pregnant and while nursing for a number of reasons. DHA is a predominant structural omega-3 fatty acid in the brain and retina and is passed through the placenta to the baby. In fact more than half of the brain is made up of fats the majority of which is DHA. Following childbirth it is passed through breast milk. It plays a vital role in supporting the healthy development of a baby's brain eyes and nervous system. In addition DHA is also vital for a healthy heart and cardiovascular system. By aiding in the development of these body systems GNC Prenatal DHA provides baby with the nutritional support needed during the early phases of life. And best of all each softgel is enteric coated which allows it to break down and absorb in the small intestine. This controls or reduces the unpleasant aftertaste or burps.A complete nutritional program should be followed prior to conception through pregnancy and maintenance while breastfeeding.

Men\u2019s COMPLETE LIFE Rx plus Omega-3 also includes the benefits of our new Maximum Essential Omega-3 formula which provides a unique blend of Omega-3 oils without mercury without PCBs and with no fishy aftertaste. Just as we require essential vitamins to live there are also the essential Omega-3 fatty acids that we require for life. The Omega-3s make up the trillions of cell membranes in our body and since they cannot be produced by the body their health benefits are only available by eating a diet rich in cold water fish or with a supplement like our Maximum Essential Omega-3. Research has shown that diets rich in Omega-3s are associated with superior cardiovascular (heart) nervous system (brain) and circulatory health. Unfortunately the typical American diet does not supply the Omega-3s required or recommended for good health. Our Maximum Essential Omega-3 formula provides a unique balance of both fish and flaxseed oils delivering our highest levels of all-important DHA plus EPA and ALA. The heart benefits of DHA and EPA are long established but the role of DHA in brain and eye function is by far the most important Omega-3 breakthrough in recent years. Sadly typical Omega-3 formulas focus on EPA rather than DHA but our Maximum Essential Omega-3 focuses on the more important DHA which is vital for the structure and function of the brain and eyes. In fact the highest functioning areas of the brain contain ultra-high levels of DHA with DHA making up more than 30% of the \u201cgrey matter.\u201d Plus DHA is equally critical to the eye with the highest concentration of DHA found in the macula area of the retina. Fish oil supplements have long been praised for their health benefits but are equally well-known for their unpleasant aftertaste and potential contaminants; however our Maximum Essential Omega-3 allows you to enjoy all the benefits of fish oil without worrying about mercury contaminants or fishy aftertaste. Men\u2019s COMPLETE LIFE Rx plus Omega-3 does not employ difficult to digest tablets and instead comes as a mild pure additive-free powder in small soft easy-to-swallow capsules. The ultra-fine non-acidic powder in each capsule most efficiently delivers its benefits while also being gentle even to the most sensitive stomach. Most importantly unlike typical one-pill-per-day multi-vitamins that never deliver the levels a man truly requires Men\u2019s COMPLETE LIFE Rx provides a comprehensive list of essential vitamins minerals and carotenoids at the potency levels respecting the scientific research and the needs of men.","206655":"For answers to questions about the use of this product call 800.800.1200.

Lutein is most effective at protecting delicate eye tissues from ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the normal aging process.
